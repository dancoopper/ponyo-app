# Ponyo-app
### I made this from scratch for a friend who is really into space. There was not an API at the time of making this app so I had to resort to web scraping. I have made a new and better version of this app in Go (using the API) which you can find in my pined repositories  

## main.py
###### This is where I import everything 

## img.py
###### This is the render-er 

## clean.py 
###### This makes sure that the folder gets emptied when you close the app 

## scraper.py
###### This goes to the site, finds and downloads the image and puts it in the "nasa_pics" folder
